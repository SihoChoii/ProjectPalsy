*decision matrix*

We decided to use a shape that would be similar to the Quest 2's controllers, since it has an ergonomic design for prolonged use.

Furthermore, we began to design a version of our controller on Autodesk:

With our ideas set, we began soldering, and working on the internal hardware of our device, specifically the integration of the inertia measurement unit. This give us the ability to sense motion, and would be a key component in the exergaming interaction. The inertia measurement unit (IMU) will be a key factor in assisting the hand-eye-coordination of our patients.
